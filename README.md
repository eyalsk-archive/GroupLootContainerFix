# GroupLootContainerFix

Apparently the `GroupLootContainer` frame isn't being removed properly
and it blocks the `WorldFrame` from receiving the mouse events so this addon is an attempt to fix that.

**Things I don't know:**

* I don't know whether Blizzard broke this before patch 8.1 or after it.
* I don't know whether an addon is causing it but to me this seems really unlikely and more like a bug Blizzard introduced.

**Notes**

I haven't tested it at all yet so keep this in mind; it's only an attempt at fixing the problem and shouldn't be considered the solution.

### **Enjoy!**
